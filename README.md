# Shuffle CLI 
The Shuffle CLI helps you develop, test and deploy apps to Shuffle more easily.

**ALPHA: We are building this to check if it is of interest or not. It does not have a binary version published, so build it first: `go build`**

## Usage
```bash
$ shufflecli --help
```

Upload an app:
```bash
$ shufflecli app upload <filepath>
```

Coming soon~
```bash
$ shufflecli app test 
```

## Coming features
- Full App testing
- Testing scripts by themselves
- Workflow building (maybe)
- Organization administration (maybe)
